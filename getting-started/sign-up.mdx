First of all we need to login with our Internet Identity. You can use any Internet Identity you have, or create a new one at [Internet Identity](https://identity.ic0.app/).

If this is our first access, we need to register by specifying a username:

</Frame>

Then we submit the request and the orchestrator will start to create a storage canister for us. This can take a few seconds, so please be patient.

And eventually after the canister is created, we will be redirected to the main page of Docutrack and we'll see our username in the topbar.
