# Sharing a file

Once a file is uploaded, we can share it with other users.

In this case, we want to share the passport picture with Luca. We click on the "Share" button next to the file in the list of files.

From the name field we can select Luca from the list of users that have access to our storage canister.

Once the file is shared, we can see the list of users that have access to the file in the "Access" section.
