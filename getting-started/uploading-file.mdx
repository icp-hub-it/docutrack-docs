# Uploading a file

At this point we want to upload a new document on Alice's storage canister, but from a different browser, maybe with an unknown user. So the first step is to create a new upload request. We click on the "Create new file request" button and fill in the form with the details of the request.

This will generate a link with a UUID that we can share with Bob. We can copy the link and send it to Bob via email, chat, or any other means.

Then Bob can open the link in his browser, and he will be able to upload the file. He clicks on the "Upload file" button, selects the file (in this case, a passport picture), and submits it.

Once the file is uploaded, Bob will see a confirmation message and the file will be stored in Alice's storage canister.

If we now go to our files, we'll see the uploaded file in the list of files.

And we can also click on the file to see its details, including the file name, size, and the date it was uploaded.
