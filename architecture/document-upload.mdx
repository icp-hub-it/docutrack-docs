When a document is to be uploaded, a symmetric secret key for the document is created in the (potentially unregistered) user's frontend.

In the example above, this user is called Bob. The document is encrypted with this secret key.

As a next step, the frontend obtains the public key of the registered user who created the request link, Alice, from the backend.
The documentâ€™s secret key is encrypted for Alice.

Both the encrypted document and the encrypted secret key are sent to the backend where they are stored.
