## User Registration

Users are linked to their [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/internet-identity) in the frontend after login, the corresponding principal will be used for calling backend API queries and
updates.

After registration a public / private key pair is created for the user.
The public key is stored in the **Orchestrator** for each registered user, together with their name.
