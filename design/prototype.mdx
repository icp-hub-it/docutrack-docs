## Interactive Wireframes

We have developed the first comprehensive wireframe of DocuTrack's complete user interface, featuring full interactive prototyping capabilities built in Figma.

<Info>
  **The prototype includes all core user flows, from onboarding to document management, sharing, and collaboration features.**

### Design Approach

<Accordion title="Persona-Driven Methodology">
  The wireframes reflect our persona-driven design methodology, ensuring each interface element serves the specific needs of our target users:

  - **Institutional confidence** for compliance and legal professionals
  - **Streamlined workflows** for financial analysts and operations teams  
  - **Privacy-first interface** for security-conscious individual users
  - **Enterprise-grade presentation** suitable for corporate environments
</Accordion>

### Next Steps

These wireframes will guide the React implementation in Phase 2, ensuring pixel-perfect translation from design to development while maintaining the interactive behaviors demonstrated in the prototype.
