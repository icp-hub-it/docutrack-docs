## Interactive Wireframes

We have developed the first comprehensive wireframe of DocuTrack's complete user interface, featuring full interactive prototyping capabilities built in Figma.

### Explore the Prototype

Our interactive prototype demonstrates:

- **Complete user onboarding flow** with Internet Identity integration
- **Document upload and organization** workflows

### Design Approach

The wireframes reflect our persona-driven design methodology, ensuring each interface element serves the specific needs of our target users:

- **Institutional confidence** for compliance and legal professionals
- **Streamlined workflows** for financial analysts and operations teams  
- **Privacy-first interface** for security-conscious individual users
- **Enterprise-grade presentation** suitable for corporate environments
