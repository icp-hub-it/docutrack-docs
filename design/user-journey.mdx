User journey maps visualize the complete experience users have when interacting with DocuTrack, from initial discovery through advanced feature usage.

<Info>
  **These journeys are designed around our core personas, ensuring each user type has an optimized path through the platform.**
</Info>

## Journey Mapping Methodology

Our user journeys are built using a persona-first approach:

1. **Persona Goals**: Each journey starts with specific user goals from our defined personas
2. **Touchpoint Analysis**: We identify every interaction point between user and platform
3. **Emotion Mapping**: We track user emotions and frustrations throughout the journey
4. **Optimization Opportunities**: We highlight areas for UX improvements and feature enhancements
