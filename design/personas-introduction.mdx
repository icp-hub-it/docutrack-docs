User personas are fictional characters that represent the different user types who might use DocuTrack. **These personas do not refer to real individuals but identify specific types of reference users** based on research and data about our target audience, helping us understand user needs, behaviors, and goals.

## Why Personas Matter

<Info>
  **Personas drive user-centered design decisions and technical architecture choices from the earliest stages of development.**
</Info>

### For UI/UX Development

<Accordion title="Design Decision Framework">
  Personas guide interface design by providing clear answers to critical questions:
  - **What workflows do users expect?** Understanding daily routines helps prioritize features
  - **How technical is our audience?** Determines the complexity level of exposed functionality  
  - **What devices do they use?** Influences responsive design priorities
  - **What are their pain points?** Shapes the problems our interface needs to solve
</Accordion>

### For Technical Architecture

<Accordion title="Backend Architecture Decisions">
  Personas inform backend decisions that impact user experience:
  - **Security requirements** vary by user type (individual vs enterprise)
  - **Scalability needs** depend on expected usage patterns
  - **Integration requirements** are driven by existing user workflows
  - **Performance expectations** differ based on user context and constraints
</Accordion>

## DocuTrack's Approach

Our personas represent the spectrum of users who need secure, decentralized document management. From privacy-conscious individuals to enterprise teams requiring compliance, each persona highlights different aspects of our technical and design challenges.
