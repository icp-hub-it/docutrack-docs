## Design Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research-Driven Personas">
    Our [user personas](/design/personas) represent real-world use cases spanning individual privacy advocates to enterprise compliance teams. Each persona drives specific design requirements and feature priorities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Journey-Centered Flows">
    Comprehensive [user journey mapping](/design/user-journey) identifies every touchpoint from initial onboarding through advanced collaboration features. These journeys reveal opportunities for exceptional user experiences and potential friction points.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interactive Prototyping">
    Our [Figma prototype](/design/prototype) enables stakeholder validation before development, ensuring design decisions align with user needs and technical constraints.
  </Step>
</Steps>
