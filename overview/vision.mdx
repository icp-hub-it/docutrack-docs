## The Future of Document Management

### Decentralized by Default

DocuTrack envisions a future where:

Advanced privacy features include:

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Platform operators cannot access user documents
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Documents encrypted before leaving user devices
- **Selective Sharing**: Granular control over who can access what information
- **Audit Transparency**: Complete visibility into all access and modifications
