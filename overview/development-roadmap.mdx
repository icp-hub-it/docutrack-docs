## PhaseÂ 2 (16/06 â€“ 31/10)

- **Architecture Redesign (2/2)**: Redesign the architecture to embrace the one-canister-per-user model, making sure it is suitable for the integration of the vetKD feature.

- **Latest Internet Identity Integration**: Upgrade Internet Identity libraries to the most recent versions and ensure the user flows are updated accordingly.

- **Full VetKD Integration**: Update the VetKD encryption module to the production released API.

- **Integrity Function (Log)**: Changes are tracked and visible to all users with access to the space.

- **User Canister updates**: Implement admin endpoints to batch upgrade user canisters with orbits by providing the WASM buffer.

- **Frontend Development**: Migration from Svelte to React in order to ensure better scalability, maintainability, and alignment with the latest development standards.
Implementation of the UI.

- **Core UX Enhancements**
Implement improvements for file uploading, deletion, and sharing.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Defines different user roles and manages what each role can see or do.
Ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions based on their role.

- **Workspaces**: Workspaces are secure, isolated environments within DocuTrack where users can manage, organize, and share documents with specific teams or collaborators.

- **Tests & Alpha Release**

## PhaseÂ 3 (01/11 â€“ 31/12)

- **Core Module Design & Implementation**: Implementation of the first version of the DocuTrack core module.

- **Selective Feature Integration**: Implementing the most critical requested modifications and features, such as storage capacity (up to 500MB/file) and latency improvements for file upload and download.

- **Sharing Confidentiality**: Documents remain confidential even when two users use the same browser instance.

- **Organizations**: Organizations are private and independent environments, designed for companies that need full control over their document management and internal users.
Each Organization operates within its own encrypted space but remains fully interoperable: companies can securely share files both with the public DocuTrack environment and with other Organizations when needed.

- **Security Review**

- **Tests, Audit & Beta Release**

## PhaseÂ 4 & Beyond (2026+)

- **Tiered Usage & Monetization**: Premium features, fair usage models.
