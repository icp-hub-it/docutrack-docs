**Focus**: Finalize RBAC with full esigner role and e-signing enhancements, ensuring full EU compliance (building to QES potential if needed), plus integrity logs and core UX improvements for uploads/deletes/sharing.

### Deliverable List:

- Technical document outlining complete RBAC and esigner implementation.
- Repository with integrity log implementation in canisters (tracking changes visible per RBAC), plus UX enhancements for file uploading/deletion/sharing (per UX docs), with benchmarking scripts for performance.
- Updated React frontend repo, fully implementing esigner UI, integrity log viewing, and compliance visuals (e.g., signature certificates).
- Deployed canisters link for testing complete RBAC/esigner flows (e-sign a versioned document with logs) and enhanced UX, including compliance benchmark reports.
