**Focus**:

a) Merge Detached head of design (deliverables mentioned in phase 1).

b) React migration, tackle II upgrades (now with AgentJS v3), and integrate VetKD as core crypto foundation. This sets secure auth and key flows early.

## Deliverable List:

- Initial React frontend repository setup, including wireframe implementation (stores, contexts, and main UI components) for core pages like dashboard, registration, and sharingâ€”migrated from Svelte with basic scalability notes.

- Technical document detailing the upgraded Internet Identity integration, including library versions, updated user flows (e.g., Gmail auth recognition for verified emails without additional challenges where feasible), and integration of new AgentJS v3.
- Repository updates with deployed canisters demonstrating II integration, allowing client testing of authenticated user sessions (e.g., login via Gmail and basic file access).
- Technical document describing the full VetKD integration, including API endpoints and secure interaction flows with user canisters.
- Repository containing updated canister codebase with VetKD implementation, including reproducible deployment instructions.
- Link to deployed canisters for independent testing of VetKD-secured operations, such as encrypted file uploads/downloads.
