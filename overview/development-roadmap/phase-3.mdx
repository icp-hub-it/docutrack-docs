**Focus**: Build robust user canister upgrade mechanism via Orbit (batch WASM handling), add admin/usage stats for network monitoring (with cost benchmarks), and update React UI to integrate these changes seamlessly.

### Deliverable List:

- Technical document outlining the user canister upgrade flow via Orbit, including admin endpoints for batch upgrades with WASM buffers, compatibility assurances, and migration mechanics.
- Repository containing updated canister codebase with Orbit-based upgrade implementation, including reproducible deployment instructions.
- Link to deployed canisters for independent testing of canister upgrades, such as batch migrating user data without low downtime.
- Admin stats dashboard implementation in the codebase, with endpoints and data structures for usage monitoring (e.g., user activity, network costs per flow like uploads/shares), including benchmark reports on cycles costs for key operations.
- Preliminary React frontend updates in the repo, integrating II flows and canister upgrade notifications into the wireframe (e.g., admin UI for stats and upgrades), with notes on migration progress from Svelte.
