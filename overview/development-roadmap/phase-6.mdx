**Focus**: Comprehensive e2e tests (leveraging our test-driven backend), benchmarks, and alpha prep for the full Phase 2 suite.

### Deliverable List:

- Comprehensive test suite repository, covering unit/integration tests for backend (already test-driven) and full end-to-end (e2e) tests for all Phase 2 features (II/VetKD, RBAC/esigner, versioning/logs, workspaces, UX enhancements), with coverage reports.
- Benchmarking document detailing performance improvements (e.g., file uploads, canister upgrades, e-signing costs), including metrics and optimization notes.
- Full alpha release package: Updated main repository with all Phase 2 code, deployment instructions, and a deployed alpha environment link for e2e testing (e.g., full user journey from registration to e-signed workspace sharing with version logs).
- Final UX/UI document summarizing the complete React-based interface, eIDAS compliance mappings, and alignments with development standards.
