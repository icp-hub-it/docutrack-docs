---

DocuTrack represents a natural evolution in the decentralized document management landscape, born from the growing need for digital sovereignty and data security.

## Project Origins

DocuTrack is an **existing proof-of-concept (PoC) decentralized application** that enables users to store and share documents securely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Originally **developed in collaboration with Bank Julius BÃ¤r**, it demonstrates the potential to become a fully polished solution showcasing ICP's unique value proposition of digital sovereignty.

## Technological Context

The Internet Computer Protocol offers a unique infrastructure for developing decentralized applications that guarantee:
