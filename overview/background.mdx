## What is DocuTrack

DocuTrack is a **proof-of-concept decentralized application** that enables secure document storage and sharing on the Internet Computer Protocol. The platform demonstrates the potential of decentralized technologies to solve real-world document management challenges while providing users with true data sovereignty.

## Why DocuTrack Exists
DocuTrack is an existing proof-of-concept (PoC) decentralized application that enables users to store and share documents securely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Originally developed in collaboration with Bank Julius BÃ¤r, it demonstrates the potential to become a fully polished solution showcasing ICP's unique value proposition of digital sovereignty.

The current document management landscape is dominated by centralized solutions that create several critical problems:
